# Example Description: 
 
# A python sample program utilizing pyvisa to connect and control a Keysight FieldFox 
# Family Combination Analyzer. 
# 
# The application performs the following:
 
# Imports the pyvisa libraries and operating system dependent functionality;
# Establishes a visa resource manager;
# Opens a connection to the FieldFox based on the instrument's VISA address as
# acquired via Keysight Connection Expert
# Sets the visa time out (increasing the timeout as compared to the default). 
# Clears the event status register and thus clears the error queue;
# Defines an error check function and checks the system error queue;
# Presets the FieldFox unit; performs a *IDN?, sets the analyzer to Spectrum Analyzer 
# mode, 
# then queries the number of points, start frequency and stop frequency.
# Executes a synchronized single sweep. 
# Queries the spectrum analyzer trace data, builds a linear array to compute the 
# stimulus array, 
# and plots the stimulus - response data as an X-Y trace. 
# 
# Import the visa, csv, and math libraries

# array
